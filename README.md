## What is a digital garden? 

A digital Garden is close to a blog. 

Tom Critchlow, a consultant who has been cultivating his [digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) for years, spells out the main difference between old-school blogging and digital gardening. “With blogging, you’re talking to a large audience,” he says. “With digital gardening, you’re talking to yourself. You focus on what you want to cultivate over time.”
