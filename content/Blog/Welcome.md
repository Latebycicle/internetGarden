Welcome to my Internet Garden. Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated by little corners of the internet that people are still maintaining. Itâ€™s like wandering into a pretty garden in a game like Undertale. I love the feeling and decided that I want to create my own little garden that people can stumble into. 

I hope HMR works alright perfect. I would have honestly prefered using Vitepress to build this but this seemed like such a novel solution
