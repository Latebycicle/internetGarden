I&#39;m subscribed to their Instagram page, and every event poster they put out is well-put-together and really thoughtfully designed.

Having multiple elements on the same row after center-aligned text will lead to a breakdown in visual hierarchy and confusion.</p><p>![[badcolcposter.png]] This initial draft of a poster for my project&#39;s poster is a good example. Visual hierarchy is maintained for the first two lines. Following that, Due to the Caps Online Learning Center text being Left aligned and having the same precedence as the QR code, It breaks down the visual hierarchy and leaves the audience a little confused.</p><p>Maintaining Symmetry (Top Left vs Bottom Right), Emphasizing the main message and aligning the text to compliment the QR code lends some much-needed relief to the poster.</p><p>![[bettercolc.png]]</p><p>Separating/Grouping elements into distinct blocks of information or creating negative space between groups of elements lends relief and re-establishes visual hierarchy.</p><h2 id="the-main-takeaways" tabindex="-1">The Main Takeaways <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-main-takeaways" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Main Takeaways&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>The facilitator, Mrs Diya Deviah, then touched upon some very helpful topics you aren&#39;t really exposed to while learning about design: What happens after you design something?</p><h3 id="call-to-action" tabindex="-1">Call to Action <a class="header-anchor" href="#call-to-action" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Call to Action&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><blockquote><p>A call to action is what eventually guides your audience to the next steps they have to take after looking at your poster.</p></blockquote><p>Call to action can be of various types, e.g. a Link to purchase tickets on a promotional poster or a link to a WhatsApp group / Instagram page / E-Mail List for an Awareness poster. This Call to Action must be clear, distinct and direct as you&#39;re trying to guide them to a desired outcome.</p><h3 id="control" tabindex="-1">Control <a class="header-anchor" href="#control" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Control&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Once you&#39;re done designing a poster and it&#39;s distributed in print or online, you can say that it is out of your control.</p><p>QR Codes are now the most popular form of Call To Action as you can easily lead them to a place where they can be more involved. While making a QR Code, make sure that the link it leads to is</p><ul><li>Complete</li><li>Ideally, Dynamic This is because, Once it&#39;s out of your control, You can no longer change the QR Code(link) itself. If the link to your Google form for registrations changes, you won&#39;t be able to update a static QR Code.</li></ul><h3 id="digital-posters" tabindex="-1">Digital Posters <a class="header-anchor" href="#digital-posters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Digital Posters&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Digital formats are usually easier to manage as you generally have fewer things to worry about, but, you must still consider the ease of Action.</p><p><strong>Ease of Action</strong> - This is about how easy it is for people to perform/go through with the call to action on your design. - If it&#39;s a QR code on an image, People will have to take more steps to get to the link as they have to screenshot it and then use the scan from gallery option to get to the link. - Make sure that, wherever possible, embedded links are attached to the QR code so that clicking on it will open the link.</p><h3 id="physical-posters-distribution-circulation" tabindex="-1">Physical Posters - Distribution &amp; Circulation <a class="header-anchor" href="#physical-posters-distribution-circulation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Physical Posters - Distribution &amp; Circulation&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>For physical posters, there are a couple of extra steps inbetween designing your poster and the poster reaching your audience that you have to be mindful of.</p><ul><li><strong>How it&#39;s being printed</strong> - This is an extremely underrated concern when designing a poster. You need to keep in mind that the colours of your design will vary a lot between your DCI-P3 colour-calibrated display and the barely maintained printers that your posters are coming out of. The beautiful green you designed might look watered down in the final print.</li><li><strong>Where it&#39;s going</strong> - You have to scout out or, at least, be mindful of where your posters will be put up. Generally, there&#39;s going to be a lot of competition for people&#39;s attention on notice boards or public billboards, and your poster has to stand out. This is generally achived by contrasting your design with the general trend of other posters.</li><li><strong>Who is putting it up</strong> - When outsourcing distribution work, the person putting the posters up might not have the same priorities as you. Based on your design, ensure that the person putting the posters up thinks before they do so. (I&#39;m not encouraging micromanagement, but I&#39;ve had to adopt a no-delegation rule for a reason ðŸ˜”)</li></ul><h3 id="design-language" tabindex="-1">Design Language <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-language" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design Language&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><blockquote><p>When designing a whole, you need to make sure that all its parts follow the same design language to maintain visual hierarchy.</p></blockquote><p>For example, you have a blog that automatically displays the latest written article on the front page. If your blog&#39;s landing page is minimal and the image you use for the article&#39;s cover is bright and playful, It breaks the visual hierarchy and leads people to look at the image first. Always maintain consistency in colour and design on all the pages that you&#39;re working on.</p><h3 id="brief-visual-impact" tabindex="-1">Brief Visual Impact <a class="header-anchor" href="#brief-visual-impact" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Brief Visual Impact&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>You&#39;re designing your poster with the intention of grabbing your audience&#39;s attention and maintaining visual hierarchy throughout. But, in the real world, it&#39;s more likely for people to not follow through reading your poster all the way from the top to the bottom. You need to design with the understanding that engagement is temporary and people are more likely to read only half or a quarter of the information on the poster. The goal is to make sure that this 50% or 25% of the poster they read is enough to convey the purpose or idea that you&#39;re trying to get across with your poster.</p><p>![[The Art of Visual Storytelling.png]]</p><p>![[artofvisualstorytellingposter.png]]</p><hr><p>Event Name: Summer Music Festival 2025 Venue: Open air amphi, Cubbon Park Date: June 15th 2025, 5pm - 11pm Attractions: Live music, Food, pet friendly Call to action: Website</p><blockquote><p>Grab someone&#39;s attention first before giving them more information</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Design should be made from the perspective of the audience.</p><p>Ease of actions &amp; <strong>Call to action</strong>( Give people direction and purpose)</p><p>Distribution and circulation of posters - Where it&#39;s going and Who is distributing/pasting it, <strong>How is it going to circulate/be printed</strong></p><p>When working on a website/blog where assets for sub-elements are chosen based on need, It has to conform to the Design guidelines of the Main page / wherever it&#39;s going to be displayed</p><p>F/Z format for posters.
